1. The Role of Complementarity in Couple Relationships" by Diana Hess and Paula McAvoy:
This article might discuss how, in romantic relationships, individuals with different communication styles may initially be drawn to each other because their differences complement each other. For instance, one partner may be more extroverted and talkative, while the other is quieter and more introverted. This initial complementarity can lead to engaging and balanced interactions.
However, the article may emphasize that for long-term relationship success, commonalities in values, goals, and core beliefs play a critical role. These shared elements provide a foundation that supports and sustains the complementarity.

2. "Diversity and Group Performance: Recognizing and Minimizing the Detrimental Effects of Faultlines" by Ruth Kanfer, Robin J. Cohen, and Anne M. Barlow:
This article could discuss how diverse teams in a workplace might have members with contrasting skills, expertise, and problem-solving approaches. This complementarity can lead to innovative solutions and more comprehensive decision-making processes.
However, the article may also highlight that effective management and a common organizational culture are essential for minimizing potential issues arising from these differences. Common goals and shared values within the group are crucial for achieving optimal group performance.

3. "The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies, and Nations" by James Surowiecki:
This book might explore how a diverse group of individuals, each with their own perspectives and knowledge, can collectively make more accurate predictions or decisions compared to a single expert.
However, the book likely emphasizes that this collective wisdom is dependent on the presence of diverse viewpoints combined with the independence of decision-makers. It's not just about being different; it's about having a common objective and independent judgment.
