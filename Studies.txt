Studies supporting opposite or complementary personalities attracting - 

“The association between personalities and friendship was mixing. Two students tended to have closer friendship relations if they had very similar personalities in extroversion and imagination. At the same time, if they were very dissimilar in those two personality traits, their friendship was more likely  to  fall  in  a  higher  level  category.  Hence,  “Both  birds  of  a  feather  flock together” and “Opposites attract” are possible.”

“When people are single they are more attracted to faces that are dissimilar to their own, research finds.
But, when people are already in a relationship, they are more attracted to faces that look similar to their own.
In other words: opposites attract for single people, but not for those in a relationship.”

“In two independent samples, we found that members reported greater attraction to their teams when their level of extraversion was dissimilar to the average level of extraversion of other team members. These results suggest a complementary fit relationship between extraversion and attraction that holds for extraverts as well as introverts.”

“Although  relationships  are  complex  and  endure or fail due to myriad factors, the findings of the current research corroborate the  notion  that  personality  and  complementarity  play  a  role  in  the  initia-tion and success of relationships. What may be most interesting is that these findings suggest somewhat of a discrepancy between what single individuals desire  in  a  romantic  partner  and  which  personality  combinations  are related to the experience of a loving and harmonious romantic relationship.”
